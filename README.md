# Real-Time-Air-Quality-Index-Prediction-Using-ML
RealTime Air Quality Index Pridiction of a region given climate conditions.

# Environment setup: need to install Spyder and install some libraries.

# For this project, I have followed the whole lifecycle of a Data Science Project.

Data Collection: we collected some data from real time sensor And then clean it and svae it as "AQI_Roadside.csv" Data Preprocessing: (execute Source_code.py) This data contained hourly measurements of AQI. This was converted into a dictionary format where the dictionary key is the year and values are the daily AQI values. Next, the data in step 1 was combined with data of this step to create a new CSV file "newAQI_Roadside.csv". Data Cleaning: (execute Source_code.py) create a new CSV file "newAQI_Roadside.csv" The CSV file created in step 2 was cleaned to remove null values and improper data. A new resultant CSV file was created "ReduceData_Roadside.csv". Tried various algorithm.
